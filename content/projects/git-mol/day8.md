## Collaborating with Remotes

## Commands in Play
* git remote
* git ls-remote
* git remote -v show
{{< figure src="day8-01.png" caption="Show me the remote URL using switches on `git remote` on CLI." numbered="false" >}}
	* fetch -> For the purposes of download (receive) files from a remote, you can replace this command with pull.
	* push -> Uploads (sends) files to the remote.
* git clone -> REM. This command _creates_ remote-tracking branches in the new repository. There are branches in the original repository, and these remote-tracking branches serve as bookmarks back to them.
* git branch —all
* git remote rename [origin] [new-remote-name] -> Rename those bookmarks; only affecting your local branch!
* git remote add [remote-name] [../relative-branch location]
* gh repo clone [github URL] [target-dir] -> Done by me, for me, as I have the **gh** go package installed.

## 12.1.3 Adding a remote
You can even add a remote. That’s right. Even after you make a clone, you can add another remote, which represents another repository that you want to track. If you collaborate on a repository where contributors are actively developing on their own repositories, it may be useful to add their repositories, in addition to the remote that was created when you first did the clone.
_TDB: A cool representation of this in comic form, à la what Julia Evans @b0rk does so wonderfully._

/The action of `git remote add bob ../math.bob` from dir math.carol has added a pull\push (relative) reference to bob’s repo at carol’s working area/

## 12.4 Lab
1. In dir math.github, type `git log —oneline —decorate`  
A: 
```
4465c54 (HEAD -> master, origin/master, origin/HEAD) A small update to readme.
6f6af16 Adding printf.
256d402 Adding two numbers.
23d3077 (origin/another_fix_branch) Renaming c and d.
80f5738 Removed a and b.
94abe13 Adding readme.txt
ef47d3f (tag: four_files_galore) Adding four empty files.
3847b0b Adding b variable.
2732d6a This is the second commit.
e7a974f This is the first commit.
```
2. What is the SHA1 ID of the remote-tracking branch another_fix_branch?  
A: SHA1 ID 23d3077  
3. Is there a tag or branch for the SHA1 ID ef47d3f?  
A: It’s tag: four_files_galore  
4. Are the SHA1 IDs of math.github the same as math.bob or math.clone? Why not?  
A: They are not because the local repos and files where generated by bash script and have no relation to the GitHub based remote (although the contents may otherwise be closely related e.g. four_files_galore is still empty files: a, b, c, and d.)
